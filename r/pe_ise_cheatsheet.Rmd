# Systems Definition, Analysis, and Design

## System Analysis and Design Tools

### Cause-Effect Diagram (Fishbone)

```{r}

```

### Pareto Analysis

80% of the items represent 20% of the sales or 20% of the items represent 80% of 
the cost. This law is a rule of thumb.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
items <- paste0("Item ", 1:10)
itemProbs <- c(.6, .2, rep(.025, 8))
nItems <- 10000
itemSamples <- sample(items, nItems, prob = itemProbs, replace = TRUE)
itemTable <- data.table(items = itemSamples)[
  ,.(percent = .N/nItems), by = 'items'][order(percent, decreasing = TRUE)
                                         ][,cumulative := cumsum(percent)][
                                           ,items := factor(items, levels = items)]

ggplot(itemTable) +
  geom_bar(aes(items, percent), stat = 'identity') +
  geom_step(aes(x = as.numeric(items), y = cumulative),
            color = 'red') +
  labs(title = 'Pareto Chart',
       x = "", 
       y = 'Proportion')

```

### Histogram

A bar chart where values are binned into intervals and the count or frequency is
the height of the bars.

```{r}
histData <- rnorm(10000, 100, 10)
qplot(histData, geom = 'histogram', binwidth = 10) +
  labs(title = 'Normal Distribution Sample Data (100, 10)',
       x = 'x')
```

### Scatterplot

A scatterplot is two numeric variables plotted against each other. Often used to 
visually determine if there is correlation.

```{r}

spData <- rnorm(1000, 5, 5)
qplot(spData, spData + rnorm(1000, 0, 3)) +
  labs(x = 'x',
       y = 'y')
```

### Operation Process Chart

The operation process chart only has Operations and Inspections.

### Flow Process Chart

The flow process chart forces a more detailed look at a system.

### Left Hand Right Hand Chart

Shows when each hand is busy and idle. It is sometimes called a simo chart.

### Queueing Models

**Effective vs. Offered Load:**

$$\lambda_{eff} = \lambda(1-\pi_m)$$
**Waiting Time Law:**

$$L = \sum_{n=0}^Mn\pi_n$$
$$L_q = \sum_{n=c+1}^{c-1}(n-c)\pi_n$$

**Probability of n arivals by time t:**


$$P[N(t)=n]=\frac{(\lambda t)^ne^{-\lambda t}}{n!}$$
<h5>
$M/M/1/\infty\quad Queue$
</h5>
<hr>

**Probability of customers in system:**

$$\pi_0=1-\rho$$
$$\pi_n=\rho^n(1-\rho)$$
$$L = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$$
$$L_q = L-\rho=\frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho}$$
<h5>
$M/G/1/\infty\quad Queue$
</h5>
<hr>

**Pollaczek-Khintchine Formula:**

$$L = L_q+\rho=\frac{\rho^2+\lambda^2\sigma^2}{2(1-\rho)}+\rho$$
<h5>
$M/M/c/M\quad Queue$
</h5>
<hr>

$$D = \sum_{n=0}^{c-1}\frac{\rho^n}{n!}+\frac{\rho^c}{c!}[\frac{1-(\rho/c)^{M-c+1}}{1-\rho/c}]$$
$$\pi_0=\frac{1}{D}$$

$$\pi_n= \begin{cases} 
\frac{\rho^n}{n!}\pi_0, \quad \text{n<c} \\
\frac{\rho^n}{c!c^{n-c}}\pi_0, \quad {n\geq c} 
\end{cases}$$



$$L_q=\pi_0\bigg(\frac{\rho^{c+1}}{(c-1)!(c-\rho)^2}\bigg)
\bigg[1-\big(\frac{\rho}{c}\big)^{M-c}-(M-c)\big(\frac{\rho}{c}\big)^{M-c}\big(1-\frac{\rho}{c}\big)\bigg],\quad \rho\neq c$$

$$L_q=\pi_0\bigg(\frac{\rho^c (M-c)(M-c+1)}{2c!}\bigg),\quad \rho=c$$

$$L_q=\pi_0\bigg(\frac{\rho^{c+1}}{(c-1)!(c-\rho)^2}\bigg),\quad c=\infty$$

### Linear Programming

**Procedure:**

1. Identify the primary decision variables
2. Identify the constraint linear functions
3. Identify the objective linear function
